## Description

Press a hotkey (or optionally your attack button) to toggle auto attack. You can also put it in stop on release mode which will auto attack only while the assigned key (or bound attack button) is held. Additionally there is a marksman only mode intended for use with Starwind or any other mod that adds guns as marksman weapons.

Updates are planned for the future as OpenMW Lua progresses.

## Credits/Usage

Thanks to the author of [Auto Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51348) (Merlord, original idea from tuncturel) for the code to *study* and of course also to the OpenMW Devs, without whom this mod would not be possible. Thanks to [Phi](https://github.com/phi-fell) as well as I *borrowed* the hotkey setting code from them.

Do whatever you want with it as long as money isn't involved. Credit is appreciated but not required.
