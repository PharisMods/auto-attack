## Description

Allows auto attacking when either a configurable hotkey (default 'g') or the normal attack button is pressed. Additionally, auto attacking can be configured to stop upon release of the hotkey and automatically draw/sheathe the player's weapon.

For mods such as Starwind there is both a marksman only mode in the in-game settings and a whitelist override option that will limit auto attack to those added to the provided 'weaponWhitelist.lua' file.

## Credits/Usage

Thanks to the author of [Auto Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51348) (Merlord, original idea from tuncturel) and of course also to the OpenMW Devs, without whom this mod would not be possible. Thanks to [Phi](https://github.com/phi-fell) as well as I *borrowed* the hotkey setting code from them.

Do whatever you want with it as long as money isn't involved. Credit is appreciated but not required.
